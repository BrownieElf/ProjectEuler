#Largest palindrome product
#Problem 4
#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
#The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

  (10..99).each do |num|
    product = number * num if (number * num).to_s == (number * num).to_s.reverse
    palindromes << product
  end
